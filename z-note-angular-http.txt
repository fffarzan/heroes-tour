NOTE: 
    1- We use `In-memory Web API` module to mimic communication with a
    remote data. 
    2- When the server is ready, the In-memory Web API will be detach  , 
    and the app's requests will go through to the server.
    3- Installing:
        npm install angular-in-memory-web-api --save
    4- The `HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule` module intercepts HTTP 
    requests and returns simulated server responses.
